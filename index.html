            Welcome to my webstie. My name is Isaiah, and I love everyting
            I.T. In fact, the website that you are looking at was coded by
            me. I did the whole thing by hand with no A.I help in any way.
            However, that does not put me out of date. I am currenly studing
            on how to be an ethical hacker. That means that I am always
            doing my best to stay up to date on the latest developments and
            trends in the I.T world. It also means that security is a high
            priority for me. I often make it a habit to do things the best
            practice way, and if I do not know what that way is, I will go
            and find out.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are confused and do not know where to begin browsing this
            website, then I reccomend that you start in articles. Articles
            are going to make up the bulk of this website. They can contain
            anything from a discussion on a I.T topic, to making statements
            about conversial technologies, to talking over a moment that I 
            learned from. Projects, on the other hand, are step-by-step
            instructions on how to build something the way I did. I also
            take the time to explain why I did it that way.
        </p>

            Before you go off clicking every link in this website, there
            is something that you should keep in mind. This
            website is still under heavy construction. So if things do not
            work the way they are suposed to, I apologize for the inconvience.
