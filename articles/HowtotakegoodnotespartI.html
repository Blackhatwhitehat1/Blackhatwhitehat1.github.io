    <h2>How to take Good Notes Part I</h2>

    <p>
        Learning how to take good notes in an integral part to any endeavor
        one may under take it in life. The reason is because human beings are
        inherently forgetful in the modern age.  This however, is not entirely
        our fault.  With the internet becoming a more and more critical part
        of our lives, the amount of information that humans have access to is
        higher that it has ever been.  With all this information coming at us
        all the time, it becomes next to impossible to remember all the
        important things that we need to keep in our minds.  Therefore, we can
        lighten the load by taking note of the things that we find important.
        In this way we can have the page remember what the important date, 
        fact, or name instead of trying to keep in our heads. This in turn will
        allow us to have more space to feel less stressed and to be more 
        creative.  However, before you can develop your own note taking system,
        you will need to identify which style of note taking works best for
        you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The topic of note taking is a very big and there are as many answers
        as there are people in the world. The only important thing that matters
        is that the system that you develop works for you. In order to make
        this topic easier to understand I have taken the liberty of breaking
        up note taking into three unique styles.  These styles are digital,
        paper, and hybrid. We take a look at each of these in detail, looking
        at the strengths and weaknesses of each.  This should give you a good
        idea of which note taking style is the best fit for and the situation
        that requires you to take notes.
    </p>

    <p>
        A digital note taking system is one that takes place exclusively on a
        computer. They typically use apps such as Obsidian [personal favorite],
        Ever Note, or One Note. These systems have their advantages in the
        fact that you can make notes faster; your notes can be more easily
        searched; and you can have the notes backed to the cloud with little
        to no effort.  This will make your notes able to be accessed from
        anywhere.  This also make them able to stand the test of time a lot
        better than more analog methods. The downside to method is going to be
        the fact that you always need a computer to have access to your notes.
        If you are accessing them through the cloud then you will need an
        internet connection. Also you will not retain the information as well
        compared to when you write them out by hand.

        Paper is considered one of the best and easiest ways to take notes.
        Not only will you remember the things that you take note of longer. 
        You will never lose access to your notes for as long as you have the
        physical note book. However, there are quite a few downsides to the
        style of note taking. The first one being that if you have very slow
        handwriting then you will have a really hard time with this method.
        There are ways to speed up your handwriting, such as learning some
        short hand.  However, another thing to consider is that your notes can
        be more easily damaged.  Furthermore, if you use water based inks,
        like I do, then if a page gets wet the all the ink drains from the
        page. This can be remedied by using archival inks.  You can also stick
        with ball point pens.  However, ball points have more friction with
        the page which can slow down you handwriting and tire your hand a lot
        faster.

        A hybrid note taking system tries to get the best of both worlds. 
        However, everyone has their own idea on how to undertake the system.
        I personally think that you should take written notes during the lecture
        and copy them into a computer system as the end of class.

        That sums up the note taking styles.  Please stay tuned for next
        weekâ€™s article where I go over how to take good notes that will
        help you remember the information.  Now go touch grass and have a nice
        day.
