    <h2>What is Bug Bounty Hunting?</h2>

    <p>
        The internet is a very dangerous place.  The best way to describe
        it would be like a wild west.  In this wild west there are outlaws
        called hackers.  These hackers are after the most valuable currency
        known to man.  This currency is what is often called data.  This
        data can contain anything from banking information to classified
        intulectual property.  In order to defend this sensitive data 
        companies often enlist a class of hackers called penetration testers.
        Their job is to find the vulnerabilities before the real hackers do.
    </p>

    <p>
        We now need to ask ourselves how does bug bounty hunting fits into
        this bigger picture.  First, we need to understand an important
        cyber security principle.  The feild of Cyber-Security is slit into
        two main categories, red team and blue team.  Blue is on the
        defense, such as configuring firewalls.  Red is on the offense.
        They try to break the security measures put in place by the blue
        team.  This puts red at an advantage.  This because while blue
        needs to find every single vulnerabilities, red needs to only find
        one to compromise an entire system.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, I still have not answered what bug bounty hunting is.
        Bug bounty hunting is a part of red team operation called
        penetration testing.  Penetration testing is where a company hires
        a hacker to find vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.  In the
        case of bug bount hunting, hackers must hack and report their
        findings to the company and are paid on the severity of the
        vulnerability found.
    </p>

    <p>
        So how does one get into bug bounty hunting?  Their are many
        different routes you could go.  However, the best one that I found
        is a place called <a href="https://www.hacker101.com/">Hacker101</a>
        which has video courses on how to do bug bounty hunting.  It will
        teach you about internet protocols and potential exploits within
        them.  They also go over how to correctly report your findings.
        They also have a free CTF to practice yours skills.  However,
        it gets better because they have a sister domain called <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">Hacker1</a>
        which gives you access to bug bounty hunting programs.  Some of the
        names that will mention hear are <a href="https://www.dyson.com/en">Dyson,</a>
        <a href="https://www.lowes.com/">Lowes,</a> and many others.  However,
        these are public programs so you need to be carefull not to reoport a
        bug that has already been reported.  I will also mention when a
        company does this they are often called Vulnerability Disclosure Program.
        The best part about all this is that it is free.  From the training
        to joining the programs is free but you have to be willing to put
        the work in because it is far from easy money.  So if you want to
        become a bug bounty hunter.  What are you waiting for?  You can only
        make money doing this.
